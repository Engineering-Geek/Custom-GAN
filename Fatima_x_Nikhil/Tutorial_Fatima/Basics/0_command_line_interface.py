Babe, you need to learn how to use the thing to the right, the black thing called a command line interface

This thing will help navigate our files. Click on it and type "ls"
"ls" stands for list, and it will show you all the folders you can access and files
type "cd" and folder name. Like this: "cd Fatima_x_Nikhil"
press enter, and you are now inside that folder
Press ls and see what folders and files you can run
using "cd .." will move you up 1 folder space
just typing "cd" without anything else will take you to the top folder

now make your way over to the "basics" folder where this and another printing tutorial is located
now type "python printing.py" and enter, this will run that program
